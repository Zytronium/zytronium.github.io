# Zytronium - My Developer Website

Welcome to the personal website of **Zytronium**, a passionate developer from Oklahoma with a love for programming, space, gaming, and making things look awesome.

## About

This site serves as a home base for my projects, experiments, and developer identity. The animated cosmic background
is from a project of mine, [Starry Starscape](https://zytronium.github.io/stars/), and the website features many of
the projects I'm most proud of, from games to tools to fun experiments. The theme reflects my personality, with a blue
and purple color scheme and a spacey background.

> **Note:** The website is a work-in-progress and evolves with my skills and interests. However, it has met its MVP.
